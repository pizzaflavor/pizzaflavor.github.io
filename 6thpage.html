<dt><b>New Opportunities</b></dt>
      <dd>Bitcoin has created a new job market for many new start-ups. Like with any new technology, there are new projects surrounding the infrastructures of the blockchain.
      The blockchain has allowed for new innovations and improvements to already existing structures online and will continue to do so. More broadly, Bitcoin has opened up new
      opportunities for both businesses and individuals.
      </dd>




<dt><b>Alternate Cryptocurrencies (Altcoins)</b></dt>
      <dd>Bitcoin has undeniablly influenced programmers around the world to create something as valuable as Bitcoin. Alternate cryptocurrencies (altcoins) are cryptocurrencies
      that are fundamentally different than Bitcoin. Because Bitcoins source code is open source, its code has been used and modified or served as a map
      to create altcoins. Some altcoins are simply just experiments, while others exist to serve specific purposes that Bitcoin doesn't. Some hold monetary value, while others don't.
      If the crypto-community deems an altcoin useful or a practical solution to a problem, the altcoin will most likely have at least some monetary value.
      In addition to Bitcoin, online exchanges typically offer a wide variety of altcoins.

  <dt><b>Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem</b></dt>
  		<dd>
  		<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/byz.pdf">Originally introduced</a>
  		by Leslie Lamport, Robert Shostak, and Marshall Pease, they describe a city, surrounded by the Byzantine army in groups of generals. These generals try to formulate a plan
  		to attack the city or retreat. The problem is, some want to attack while others want to retreat. Everyone must agree on a common decision, but proves to be difficult
  		because of traitorous generals.
  			Very simply, the Byzantine Generals Problem (BGP) is a story created to demonstrate the difficulty of reaching consensus in distributed systems.
  		Satoshi Nakamoto introduced and
  		<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg09997.html">published</a>
  		his solution to the Byzantine Generals' Problem on the cryptography mailing list, explaining its context making it easier to understand.

<h3>My Opinions/Thoughts</h3>


<p id="demo" style="display:none">
  When the Internet first came to be, it was primarily only used by the military and universities.
  Today, the Internet is the backbone of most infrastructures in society.
  In a time where we as a society are so invested and dependent on technology, i think its very important to note that digital scarcity has never exited in the digital realm, until Bitcoin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nature of Bitcoin allows for a borderless, boundless, trust-less, and censorship resistant technology, 
  presenting the opportunity for new and further developments.
  Although, Bitcoin is still not as user-friendly as it could yet be for the average Joe,
  there are new companies and businesses starting up to contribute to making Bitcoin
  more easier, safer, and faster. Like with any new technology, it takes time to mature, to be understood, and eventually accepted by the masses.

<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>, inventor of Bitcoin and founder of Bitcointalk.org forum, states in a <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=583.msg11405#msg11405">post</a>:
<blockquote>
    <b><i>
    <p style="color: #FF0000">
        &quot;
          As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties:<br>

          - boring grey in colour<br>
          - not a good conductor of electricity<br>
          - not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either<br>
          - not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose<br>
          <br>
          and one special, magical property:<br>
          - can be transported over a communications channel<br>
          <br>
          If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it.<br>
          Maybe it could get an initial value circularly as you've suggested, by people foreseeing its potential usefulness for exchange.  (I would definitely want some)  Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it.
