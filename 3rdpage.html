      For those discouraged, getting started with Bitcoin is easier than it seems. 
      The first step is to generate your wallet (<i>listed below</i>).
      Once you choose what wallet you decide to go with, you want to make sure to back-up the seed your wallet has generated for you.
      This seed typically consists of a random combination of words that ultimately compile the different bitcoin addresses your wallet contains.
      As long as you have the seed, your Bitcoin is always recoverable and will not be lost or stolen. So in the case of your comptuer breaks or you
      lose your phone, the seed can be used to always recover your funds, so make sure to keep it somewhere safe and secure!
  <br>
  <br>
      After backing up your wallet's seed, you are now ready! Bitcoin utilizes the concept of public key cryptography.
      Each Bitcoin address consists of a pair of public and private keys. The public key (or Bitcoin address) is what you share with someone if you wish to be paid in Bitcoin, similar to how you would give someone your home address if they want to send a bill or letter.
      Like the key to a lock, the private key is used to prove ownership of a public key, allowing the individual to control the funds associated with that Bitcoin address.

            1 Bitcoin represents 100,000,000 bits, which is divisible to 8 decimal places. THis means that someone can choose to get "bits" or increments of Bitcoin.<
            According to <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/price/#2016-09-15,2016-09-15,close,bitstamp,USD">Coindesk.com</a>, Bitstamp's (a Bitcoin exchange) exchange rate for 1 BTC (breviation used for Bitcoin) was worth $606.70 on Friday, September 15th 2016.
          </p>

<br>
      A bitcoin address is just a shortened version of a public key (<a href="https://blockchain.info/address/14cJPhGhccsXzuDK7TmwCfPWGCJU18jeuA"><b>14cJPhGhccsXzuDK7TmwCfPWGCJU18jeuA</b></a>).
      Each Bitcoin address has its own unique QR code, conveniently allowing users to quickly scan the QR code on their mobile device to send or receive payments.<br>
      <br>
      If i sent or received any Bitcoin, the transaction history would be publically broadcasted as part of the blockchain. 
      Bitcoin transactions are confirmed by hundreds of thousands of miners who all agree that the transaction awaiting confirmation has legitimately optimized the fundamentals of Bitcoin's technology.
      Only one confirmation is needed for the Bitcoin to be accessible by the receiver, which can take anywhere between seconds to a few minutes.

    <b><u><h3>Different Types of Wallets:</b></u></h3>

    <dl>
    	<dt><b>Mobile Wallets</b></dt>
    		<dd>Whether you have and iPhone or an Android, anyone with a mobile device has the ability to download and use a wallet.
    		Some popular mobile wallets are Copay, Breadwallet &amp; Mycelium.
    		Nowadays, people and their phones are almost inseparable, making mobile wallets incredibly useful for sending funds more easily.
    		</dd>
    	<dt><b>Desktop Wallets</b></dt>
    		<dd>Desktop wallets allow people on Windows, Mac, and Linux to keep their money secure. Some popular dekstop wallets are Electrum, Bitcoin Core, Armory, &amp; MultiBit HD.
    		One thing to note about desktop wallets is that your wallet is only as secure as the computer you are using.
    		This means that you want to be absolutely positive you do not have any viruses, malware, or key-loggers that could potentially steal your information.
    		</dd>
    	<dt><b>Hardware Wallets</b></dt>
    		<dd>Hardware wallets are the safest types of wallets out there.
    		For those who have a large stash of Bitcoin, it is highly recommended to use a Hardware wallet.
    		These devices are immune to computer viruses because they store private keys inside the actual hardware, preventing any information from
    		leaving the device. Some examples of hardware wallets are TREZOR, Ledger Nano, &amp; KeepKey.
    		</dd>
    	<dt><b>Paper Wallets</b></dt>
    		<dd>Creating a paper wallet is essentially an offline wallet that is on a piece of paper.
    		However, setting up a paper wallet is tedious to most people. To generate a secure offline paper wallet, one must be disconnected from the Internet and be on a computer free from viruses.
    		When printing the wallet, people now also have to weary of advanced printers that store information which can potentially compromise your security.</dd>

    Former Bitcoin Core developer Mike Hearn, stated at <a href="https://bitcointrezor.com/">https://bitcointrezor.com/</a>:
    <blockquote>

            <div style="color: #FF0000">
            &quot;TREZOR has redefined state-of-the-art in financial security.
        Even the best banks today only issue customers with hardware calculators but these don't match the safety and ease-of-use of TREZOR.
        This project is showing that the Bitcoin community can rise to even the toughest challenges presented by truly decentralised money.&quot;</i>
